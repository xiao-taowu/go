# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the main branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
# The configuration for the `remote` backend.
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
    organization = "example-organization"
    # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
    workspaces {
      name = "example-workspace"
    }
  }
}

# An example resource that does nothing.
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  triggers = {
    value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
  }
}
